# Helios Rule Engine: Architecture Overview

Helios is a lightweight, extensible rule engine for event-driven systems, optimized for low-latency evaluation (sub-ms per rule) and high throughput (10k+ events/sec). Built in Java 25, it leverages immutable data structures for thread-safety and pluggable interfaces for customization.

## Key Components
- **Event Model**: Immutable records (Java 25) representing inputs (e.g., transactions).
- **Rule Set**: Pluggable conditions and actions, stored as POJOs or JSON.
- **Engine Core**: Handles compilation, caching, and evaluation.
- **Integrations**: Hooks for Kafka, Spring Boot, or custom streams.

## High-Level Design
The system follows a pipeline: Ingestion → Compilation → Evaluation → Action.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
actor "Event Source" as ES
participant "Ingestion Layer" as IL
participant "Compiler" as C
participant "Evaluator" as E
participant "Action Sink" as AS

ES -> IL: Emit Event
IL -> C: Parse & Compile Rules
C -> E: Load Compiled Rules
IL -> E: Evaluate Event
E -> AS: Trigger Actions
